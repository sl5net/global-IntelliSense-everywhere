English: Automates context-sensitive writing and action.

Audience/target group: Programmers, writers, Windows Power users, Autohotkey lovers

what its not:
- although that is originally was , its not anymore a simple auto-completion list.
you can still use it for that, but that's just a subset of the features.

- Its not Swiftkey for Windows
The SwiftKey keyboard makes typing easier and adapts to your writing style.
It's a good idea to use both at the same time. it wokrs very well in parallel with other intellisense or auto-completion lists ( https://support.swiftkey.com/hc/en-us )

if you use it, please share your ActionLists with the community.

(Suggestions for improvement, criticism, questions are expressly desired. Many Thanks.)


Please configure ActionList by any texteditor you like.
and you may wanna edit the ActionListNameFilter.inc.ahk inside your new folder ( ActionLists/YourNewClass/ActionListNameFilter.inc.ahk ).

There is also a global 
/ActionLists/ActionListNameFilter.inc.ahk
you may wanna edit ( ActionLists/YourNewClass/ActionListNameFilter.inc.ahk ).

The ActionListNameFilter.inc.ahk files are meant to be redirected to ActionLists (superglobal, global or local, ...) if you do not have the normal configuration.

Please handle the globals ActionListNameFilter.inc.ahk carefully, as it could be otherwise that the whole script does not work anymore.

The first steps will probably be that you only edit the ActionLists / YourNewClass / yourNewTitle.ahk. The simplest change is just to add one line of text.
